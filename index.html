                    <li>Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia. They have grey fur with a cream-coloured chest, and strong, clawed feet, perfect for living in the branches of trees!</li>
                    <li>Cuddly critters, koalas measure about 60cm to 85cm long, and weigh about 14kg.</li>
                    <li>Although you may have heard people call them koala ‘bears’, these awesome animals aren’t bears at all – they are in fact marsupials. A group of mammals, most marsupials have pouches where their newborns develop.</li>
